Project: Atlas Headphones - Responsive Landing Page
Description

This project is a modern, responsive landing page for a fictional company called "Atlas Headphones." The page is designed to be visually appealing and to function seamlessly across a range of devices, from mobile phones to desktops. It features a clean, dark-themed aesthetic with vibrant call-to-action buttons.

The landing page is composed of several key sections:

    A hero section with a captivating background image and a prominent call to action.

    An "Our Results" section to showcase company achievements and statistics.
    A "Contact Us" section with a functional form for user inquiries.
    A consistent header and footer for easy navigation and brand identity.

This project is built using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid for layout, as well as media queries to ensure responsiveness.
